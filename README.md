## 🧠 Who I Am

I'm a high school student who's seriously into networking, routing, and anything that gets packets from point A to point B — efficiently, securely, and with a bit of CLI magic.

Most of what I know, I learned by tinkering with real hardware in my homelab. I reset devices constantly, mess up configs on purpose, break VLANs, fix them again, and rebuild everything better the next time. It's chaotic, but it's mine — and I document it all [here](https://github.com/AndreansxTech/My-homelab).

I’m currently preparing for the **CompTIA Network+** exam as my first real networking cert. After that? I am hoping very much for passing **MikroTik’s MTCNA**, then **CCNA** and who knows what else..

## 🛠️ What I’m Working With

Here’s the gear I use in my homelab — some is older enterprise-grade stuff, some is newer but I think it teaches me more than any simulation ever could.

- **MikroTik CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS**  
- **MikroTik CRS326-24S+2Q+RM**  
- **Brocade FastIron LS648-STK**  
- A few **Dell PowerEdge** servers for Proxmox and network experiments  
- A bunch of SFPs, serial cables, and whatever I can get my hands on

I'm building topologies, running routing scenarios, testing NAT/DHCP setups, and mixing real and virtual devices together.

---

## 📚 What I'm Learning Right Now

- Subnetting, CIDR, and IP planning  
- Layer 2/3 switching, VLAN trunking, inter-VLAN routing  
- Static + dynamic routing (RIP for now, later OSPF)  
- MikroTik RouterOS (CLI + WinBox)  
- Real-world network issues like convergence, loops, STP (just conceptually for now)  
- Monitoring tools like SNMP, LLDP, Syslog

I'm not rushing through checklists — I’m taking time to understand the “why” behind every protocol and design choice.

---

## 📈 Long-Term Goal

I want to become a professional network engineer and work with real infrastructure — routing, switching, data centers, maybe ISPs someday.

After high school, I plan to study **Computer Network Engineering**, but I want to enter those studies with a solid practical base. I’m already getting my hands dirty.
