## About Me

I’m a high school student with a strong interest in computer networking, systems administration, and data center infrastructure. I’m currently developing my skills through hands-on experience with physical hardware in my homelab environment and watching courses regarding networking. I’m also actively learning the foundational concepts covered by the CompTIA Network+ certification as part of my broader exploration of IT and networking technologies.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I’ve previously enjoyed pencil drawing, particularly more realistic takes on animated characters. I’m also interested in smartphones—especially Apple devices—and have experience with basic hardware repair on Samsung phones.

## Career Goals

My long-term goal is to work professionally in network engineering. I’m particularly interested in routing, switching, and scalable network infrastructure. To prepare for this path, I’m focusing on building practical experience and deepening my theoretical knowledge.

You can follow my journey and projects by visiting my [homelab repository](https://github.com/AndreansxTech/My-homelab).
