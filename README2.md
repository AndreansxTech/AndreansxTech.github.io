## 🔹 Profile

I’m a student working towards a career in **network engineering**, with a long-term focus on **routing, switching, and scalable infrastructure**. While I’m still in high school, my learning is structured, hands-on, and aligned with industry standards.

My goal is to build deep, practical knowledge before ever stepping into a professional environment. I treat my homelab as a personal training ground — not for hobby hosting, but for real-world networking scenarios.

## 🛠️ Lab-Based Learning

I’ve built my own physical lab environment using a mix of enterprise-grade hardware, where I test and repeat configurations across all networking layers. I’m currently focused on:

- VLAN architecture and Layer 2 design  
- Inter-VLAN routing using L3 switches  
- Static and dynamic routing (RIP, later OSPF)  
- MikroTik RouterOS: configuration and services  
- DHCP, DNS, NAT/PAT in lab conditions  
- SNMP, LLDP, Syslog for observability  
- Network segmentation and topology design

My devices include:

- MikroTik CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS  
- MikroTik CRS326-24S+2Q+RM  
- Brocade FastIron LS648-STK  
- Dell PowerEdge servers running Proxmox VE

## 📘 Certification Path

I am currently preparing for the **CompTIA Network+** certification to solidify my foundational knowledge.

This will be followed by:

- **MikroTik MTCNA / MTCRE**  
- **Cisco CCNA** (and later CCNP or ENCOR, depending on specialization)

I’m intentionally working with real devices to understand the behavior of protocols beyond simulation.

## 🧭 Vision

After graduating, I plan to study **Computer Network Engineering** at the university level — ideally while continuing to gain hands-on experience and working part-time in networking roles.

My professional interests include:

- ISP backbone design and routing  
- High-throughput switching in data center networks  
- Redundancy, convergence, and traffic engineering  
- Multi-vendor environments (MikroTik, Cisco, Brocade, etc.)

I’m not interested in shortcuts — I want to build a career based on technical depth, not checklists.
