## 🚀 About Me

I'm Andreansx, a high school student with a strong passion for networking technologies. My primary interest lies in gaining a deep understanding of network routing, switching, and scalable infrastructures—particularly those found in ISP and data center contexts. While I am still at the beginning of my professional journey, every day is focused on gaining practical knowledge and technical proficiency.

My homelab is my primary classroom: it’s not a static setup or hobby, but rather a dynamic environment where I rigorously test theories, deliberately break configurations, and rebuild networks to gain a solid understanding of both fundamental and advanced networking concepts.

## 🖥️ My Networking Lab

My approach to learning involves practical experience on real hardware, building scenarios that closely simulate enterprise and ISP network operations. I maintain detailed documentation of every scenario to ensure repeatability and deep comprehension.

Current lab equipment includes:

- **Routers and Switches:**
  - MikroTik **CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS** (for advanced routing scenarios, traffic shaping, and firewall testing)
  - MikroTik **CRS326-24S+2Q+RM** (used for L2 switching, VLAN trunking, inter-VLAN routing practice)
  - Brocade **FastIron LS648-STK** (Layer 2/3 switching, VLANs, basic routing protocols)

- **Servers and Virtualization:**
  - Dell PowerEdge R610 and R710 servers for Linux-based networking tools and infrastructure management

I use real-world equipment to learn:
- Layer 2 switching, VLAN segmentation, 802.1Q tagging
- Inter-VLAN routing, Layer 3 switching configurations
- Routing fundamentals: Static routes, RIP v1/v2, and basics of dynamic routing protocols
- MikroTik RouterOS configuration, CLI, firewall rules, NAT, DHCP, DNS
- Network monitoring and discovery using SNMP, LLDP, Syslog
- Protocol behavior under stress (STP, convergence, failover scenarios)

Detailed documentation and diagrams are available in my [Homelab Repository](https://github.com/AndreansxTech/My-homelab).

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies I Use or Admire

Here are some of the technologies, platforms, and vendors that shape my learning journey or inspire my approach to infrastructure:

- **MikroTik** — my go-to platform for routing, switching, and network experimentation  
- **Cloudflare** — I use Cloudflare Pages and DNS for deployments and security experiments  
- **Apple** — long-time user of Apple devices, with a strong interest in their hardware design and networking stack  
- **Brocade** — working with really old switches is interesting to me and some reverse-engineering brings me fun

## 🎯 Certification & Education Roadmap

I’m committed to a structured, disciplined approach to networking education:

- **Currently studying:** CompTIA Network+
- **Next steps:** MikroTik MTCNA → MTCRE → Cisco CCNA
- **Higher education goal:** Bachelor’s in Computer Network Engineering

I deliberately sequence my learning to first grasp the theoretical basis and then solidify that theory with practical, hands-on labs—building real-world applicable skills rather than mere paper certifications.

## 🌐 Career Aspirations

I aim to build a career in professional networking, particularly interested in:
- ISP backbone infrastructure and advanced routing solutions (OSPF, BGP, MPLS)
- Data center switching, redundancy, load balancing, and scalable designs
- Multi-vendor interoperability and integration (Cisco, MikroTik, Juniper, Brocade)
- Traffic engineering and network optimization at scale

My philosophy is simple: depth and understanding matter more than superficial familiarity. My career will be built on technical proficiency and hands-on expertise, ensuring reliability and excellence in any professional networking environment.
